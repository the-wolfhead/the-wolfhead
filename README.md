## 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Otabor, a javascript full stack developer

👀 I’m interested in building effective web applications with minimalist design elements. I also love animations (which puts me in a bit of a fix--see minimalist designs). Currently, I work with 
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Express.js
- React
- Redux
- Next.js
- MySQL
- MongoDb   
- AWS
- Firebase
- Python
<!--- Need to get these icons --->
🌱 I’m currently learning rust for blockchain development as I believe blockchain is the future and would want to be a part of the wave.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects  that would see me grow in experience and knowledge. I would however prefer something AI related.
